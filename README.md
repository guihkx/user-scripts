<h1 align="center">🎲 Random User-Scripts 🎲</h1>

## Description

These are random user-scripts that I use. They can add features to a website, or remove annoying ones. 🙃

## HOWTO

First, you need a user-script manager, which is an extension for your web browser that allows user-scripts to work.

So, choose **one** of the user-script managers below and install it:

* Violentmonkey **(recommended)**: https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/
* Tampermonkey: https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Then, just click to install any of these user-scripts:
